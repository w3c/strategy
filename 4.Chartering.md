# Chartering

The (Process 5.2.3)[https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview] requires us to seek AC review of at least four weeks
for "every new or substantively modified Working Group or Interest Group
charter."

Chartering: We get to this stage when we have a pretty solid idea that
there's standardization work to be done in an area, what that work looks
like, and likely support from the stakeholders necessary for it to
succeed. (We will have developed that at the previous, Evaluation stage.)

One member of the Strategy team will act as Charter Shepherd. The
Shepherd manages the development of the charter draft, including
securing horizontal reviews of the charter, identifying and speaking
with proposed chairs, and suggesting skills and time needed for team
contact. He/she should also have a sense of the ecosystem support and probe
for likely objections based on the advance notice. Our goal threshold is
still to have 5% of the membership support a charter proposal, with no
un-addressed objections, before we begin work. When we have a charter in
this shape, we'll bring it to W3M for review.

The Shepherd may solicit the help of another team member, for example 
to contribute the editorial work; this is typically case when the Shepherd 
is not expected to be the staff contact (and
the proposed staff contact should then be involved in the chartering from the start). 
In other cases the Shepherd plays both the strategy and the editorial 
roles for the new charter, e.g., when the he/she is expected to be the 
proposed staff contact as well.
	
Upon W3M approval (after responding to any questions raised there), the
charter Shepherd works with Comm to post the proposed charter and
prepare the AC notice and review form (WBS). You should monitor the WBS
as the review period progresses to make sure that expected supporters
are reviewing and to respond early to suggestions and Formal Objections.

When the review period closes, we'll prepare a disposition of comments
and determine whether we need to make any changes to address suggestions
or Objections. If any changes are made, share the charter and diff from 
what was sent for AC review with all who reviewed the charter. 
We'll bring this disposition to W3M, including a
recommendation whether any updates require a formal re-review. 
When W3M approves, the
Shepherd works with Comm to announce the chartering and then we hand the
package to Project Management.
