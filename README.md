# Strategy

### The [W3C Strategy Team's Incubation Pipeline (Funnel)](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/97/views/1) shows work under consideration by the [W3C Strategy team](https://www.w3.org/staff/strat/). 

# Charter issues status

A [charter cashboard](https://www.w3.org/2024/03/charters-in-dev.html) presents a view of the ongoing issues related to charters.

# Pipeline

The pipeline reads from left to right. Most issues (cards) start in Exploration and move forward or move out of the funnel.

0. [Exploration](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/0.Exploration.md)
1. [Investigation](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/1.Investigation.md)
1. [Incubation](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/2.Incubation.md)
1. [Evaluation](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/3.Evaluation.md) 
1. [Chartering](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/4.Chartering.md)

The pipeline is one method for the Strategy Team to do our work in and with the public.  We aim to enhance the communications required by [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process) with discussion here and periodic summaries.

We began working with this tool in late 2016, and it remains a work in progress. Members of the community are welcome to comment on existing issues and to contribute new issues. [Issue templates](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/new/choose) are available to guide you in providing relevant information.
